This crate provides a [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) plugin for integrating with
the Steamworks SDK.

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bevy-steamworks = "0.12"
```

The steamworks crate comes bundled with the redistributable dynamic libraries
of a compatible version of the SDK. Currently it's v158a.

If you wish to enable serde support add the following:

```toml
[dependencies]
bevy-steamworks = { version = "0.12", features = ["serde"] }
```

## Usage

To add the plugin to your app, simply add the `SteamworksPlugin` to your
`App`. This will require the `AppId` provided to you by Valve for initialization.

```rust no_run
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy_steamworks::*;

fn main() {
  // Use the demo Steam AppId for SpaceWar
  App::new()
      // it is important to add the plugin before `RenderPlugin` that comes with `DefaultPlugins`
      .add_plugins(SteamworksPlugin::init_app(480).unwrap())
      .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
      .run()
}
```

The plugin adds `Client` as a Bevy ECS resource, which can be
accessed like any other resource in Bevy. The client implements `Send` and `Sync`
and can be used to make requests via the SDK from any of Bevy's threads.

The plugin will automatically call `SingleClient::run_callbacks` on the Bevy
every tick in the `First` schedule, so there is no need to run it manually.

All callbacks are forwarded as `Events` and can be listened to in a
Bevy idiomatic way:

```rust no_run
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy_steamworks::*;

fn steam_system(steam_client: Res<Client>) {
  for friend in steam_client.friends().get_friends(FriendFlags::IMMEDIATE) {
    println!("Friend: {:?} - {}({:?})", friend.id(), friend.name(), friend.state());
  }
}

fn main() {
  // Use the demo Steam AppId for SpaceWar
  App::new()
      // it is important to add the plugin before `RenderPlugin` that comes with `DefaultPlugins`
      .add_plugins(SteamworksPlugin::init_app(480).unwrap())
      .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
      .add_systems(Startup, steam_system)
      .run()
}
```
